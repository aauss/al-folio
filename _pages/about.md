I am Auss, a first-gen immigrant from Iraq, cognitive scientist by training, sport enthusiast, and bassist. For the last couple of years, I have been working as a data scientist at the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) (RKI) since BC (before COVID-19) with an emphasis on digital epidemiolgy.

At RKI, I have been working on early detection of infectious diseases using natural language processing and time series analysis. During the pandemic, I was heavily contributing to Germany's response against COVID-19. I was one of the founding members to develop Germany's first national surveillance system for intensive care unit capacities, the [DIVI-Intensivregister](https://www.intensivregister.de) working as a data scientist and data engineer. In 2022, I switched to the [Information Centre for International Health Protection](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/ZIG/INIG/INIG_node.html) where I have been responsible to track international outbreak situations, using epidemic modelling and data analyses. In all positions, I was producing reports reports and analyses for political and medical stake holders. Outside of Germany, I worked on capacity building in digital epidemiology in Southern Africa, Central Asia, and soon in Southeast-Asia.

Next to my position at RKI, I am involved with the [The Focus Group on AI for Health, a partnership of ITU and WHO](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/focusgroups/ai4h/Pages/default.aspx) where I have been working as a topic group leader for outbreaks, working on standards for AI-based outbreak detection algorithms and on the working group for AI test specifications, helping other members of the focus group design and conduct tests for their AI systems.
