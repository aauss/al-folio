I am Auss, a first-gen immigrant from Iraq, cognitive scientist by training, sport enthusiast, and bassist. Since October 2024, I am a PhD student with [Prof Nigel Collier](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/nhc30) at the [Language Technology Lab](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk) at the University of Cambridge. There, I am exploring how large language models (LLMs) can be utilized for digital disease surveillance. I am specifically interested in LLMs' capability to help integrate various pieces of information like texts, maps, or mobility. Right now, I am looking into their capability to understand temporal relationships in structured data.

Before my PhD, I have been working as a data scientist at the [Robert Koch Institute](https://www.rki.de/EN/Home/homepage_node.html) (RKI) since BC (before COVID-19). There, I have been working on early detection of infectious diseases using natural language processing and time series analysis. During the pandemic, I was heavily contributing to Germany's response against COVID-19. I was in the founding team to develop Germany's first national surveillance system for intensive care unit capacities, the [DIVI-Intensivregister](https://www.intensivregister.de) working as a data scientist and data engineer. Later, I was responsible to track international outbreak situations, using epidemic modelling and data analyses. In all positions, I was producing reports and analyses for political and medical stake holders. Outside of Germany, I worked on capacity building in digital epidemiology in Southern Africa and Central Asia.
